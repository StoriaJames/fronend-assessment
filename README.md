# Storia Frontend Assessment

As part of our application process, we'd like to see what you can produce by giving you a small assignment. You can do as little or as much as your want, but any extra polish or features you might want to put in will not go unnoticed.

## The assignment

Storia Technologies is a client who has approached you to build an invoicing application. The features it should include:

 - [ ] A Login and Registration form
 - [ ] Create a new invoice
 - [ ] Add line items to the invoice. Line items may include hours of work at a certain rate, work-related expenses, materials, labor, etc.
 - [ ] Add notes to the invoice, including possibly how to pay it, where to send checks, etc.
 - [ ] Send the invoice via email (does not have to actually send emails, but if it does, great!)
 - [ ] View invoices including status (paid, outstanding, late, etc.)
 - [ ] Polished UI/UX

Your backend can be anything, and does not have to work. If you would like to use a mocked-out interface, that is fine (even static data in code is ok).

#### Extra credit features

 - [ ] Add a due date to an invoice
 - [ ] View late invoices, or even better, alert when an invoice is late
 - [ ] The ability to pay an invoice online (again, it doesnt have to work)
 - [ ] Highly reusable components
 - [ ] Tests
 
#### Design Brief
We have added Storia's style guide to this repo for your UI reference, you may use the colours and font suggestions in it.
Additionally, here are some interfaces to draw inspiration:
